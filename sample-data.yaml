  summary: "Anyone who sets out to develop software does so with a specific motivation.\
    \ Common motivations are to reduce the cost of some business process, to increase\
    \ revenue by being able to serve more customers or to create something to sell\
    \ in the case where the software itself is the product.\r\n\r\nSoftware development\
    \ is expensive and it takes quite some time to create something meaningful. Some\
    \ people see how fast you can use software to solve a problem, but rarely have\
    \ an opportunity to see what it takes to build that software in the first place.\
    \ That frequently leads to wrong expectations."
