  summary: "This is an experimental attempt to finding an explanation of why programmers\
    \ don?t want to write tests first using Activity Theory.\r\n\r\nThe programmer\
    \ is the subject and writing tests is the object. The outcome of this activity\
    \ is well tested software.\r\n\r\nAccording to Activity Theory there are rules,\
    \ community, the division of labor, as well as the mediating artifacts that influence\
    \ an activity. They themselves, are also influenced by the activity."

  language: en, summary: Software Development driven by tests (TDD) is considered a very good practice to write quality code without technical defects. TDD works well for programmers. It helps to design and test the building blocks of any software system.,

  language: en, summary: Sometimes software developers have a dream. They fantasize about working closely together with the real customer instead of being just one wheel in the big machine that produces custom software. So far this has been difficult to achieve.,

  language: en, summary: At times one needs to think a bit harder about how to test something when it goes beyond interacting with web pages or other types of user interfaces. That is usually the case when one system interacts with another. I would like to share one such case and explain my solution to the problem.,

  summary: "Anyone who sets out to develop software does so with a specific motivation.\
    \ Common motivations are to reduce the cost of some business process, to increase\
    \ revenue by being able to serve more customers or to create something to sell\
    \ in the case where the software itself is the product.\r\n\r\nSoftware development\
    \ is expensive and it takes quite some time to create something meaningful. Some\
    \ people see how fast you can use software to solve a problem, but rarely have\
    \ an opportunity to see what it takes to build that software in the first place.\
    \ That frequently leads to wrong expectations."

  language: en, summary: 'When coaching, I frequently make this observation. People
    want to receive instructions about how to do something and then move on. ?Tell
    me what to do? is the question in their mind. When I respond to their request
    by explaining why they should do something, I start to loose their interest. There
    is really no difference between a regular team member and their manager. But it
    seems to correlate with the culture of their organizations.', title: Difference Between a Mindset and a Process,

  language: en, summary: A software development team has many different tools they can use. A good craftsman knows when to use one tool and not another and why. It is experience that lets him make the right choices. The differences between the tools may be very small and they may all seem to be very similar but to the experienced craftsman the purpose of each tool is very clear and he does not use them just so.,

    about ATDD these days. And then there is Elisabeth Hendrickson?s post about The
    ATDD Arch which I like very much. The arch metaphor fits very well. ATDD is about
    bringing teams together. It is another tool in the box to prevent silos or, if
    you happen to have them already, can break them up.', title: Acceptance Test Driven Development brings teams together,

  language: en, summary: 'There is a team of 4 programmer pairs, 4 testers and 3 analysts.
    The organization expects production code to be written in pairs. They do a three
    amigo practice which requires the three amigos (analyst, tester, programmer) to
    talk about each user story before and after the implementation. User stories are
    reasonably sized. Most are about 2 or 3 points which in this organization translates
    to 2 or 3 days of work for the programmer pair and tester.', title: Focus on making the commitment leads to low quality code,
